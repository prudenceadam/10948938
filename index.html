        <h1>ABOUT </h1>
        <p>My name is Rashida Adam Prudence, I am nineteen years of age 
           I am from the northern part of Ghana, because of that Twi is not my first Language 
           I am the first born of my parents and since my childhood I've been a catholic because 
           I was given birth to it. My dad who I love most is a muslim while my mum  
           Who is my everything is a christian, she is the one who always send me to church since  
           my infacy. Due to my high academic performances, I was able to  pass my first external
           exam which is BECE with outstanding grades which helped me acquire a space in my former 
           senior high school which finds itself in the regional capital of Greater Accra and
           the capital city of the county Ghana. I am currently a level 100 student of the premier
           university of Ghana offering information technology, with my passion and focus in becoming 
           one of the best software engineers ever to work at google.
